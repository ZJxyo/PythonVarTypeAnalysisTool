# Milestone 1
### Discussions on Ideas
#### Candidate Ideas
- Control flow visualization. Mapping logical paths into a tree for visualization
- Linter for syntax and type checking. Highlighting & statistics for visualization
- Stack visualization
- Hierarchy visualization (of superclass, interfaces, etc.), similar to UML diagrams
#### Discussions
- By defining the problem statement and target audience, we can easily limit the complexity, length, and scope of the intended input program of our analysis tool. For example, we could argue that the control flow visualization tool is meant for providing visual aid of the execution process to entry level or beginner programmers. The assumption of short and simple inputs should address control flow visualizationâ€™s complexity problem.

### TA Feedback
- Control flow can get overly complex when analyzing the entire program
- Recommended to perform analyses on a subset of the program, such as methods
- Analyze a subset of the programming language to avoid complex processes such as dynamic dispatch and reflection
- Focus on the visualization if program analysis is lacking

### Follow-up Tasks
- Decide on which programming language to focus on
- Pick the idea to implement
- Sketch out the process of our analysis idea
- Flesh out the details of ideas, finalize the appropriate subset of the programming language we choose
- Design details and features
